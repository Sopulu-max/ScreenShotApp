# mainloop() is simply a method in the main window
# that executes what we wish to execute in an 
# application (lets Tkinter to start running the application). 
# As the name implies it will loop forever until the user 
# exits the window or waits for any events from the user. 
# The mainloop automatically receives events from the 
# window system and deliver them to the application widgets. 
# This gets quit when we click on the close button of the title bar. 
# So, any code after this mainloop() method will not run.
